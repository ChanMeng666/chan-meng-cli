## 📁 Package Contents

### The Demo Project: Daily Quote CLI

**What**: A simple CLI tool that displays daily inspiring quotes
**Why**: Perfect for demonstrating all spec-kit phases
**Complexity**: Beginner-friendly
**Demo Time**: 15-25 minutes

**Features**:
- Display a different quote each day
- Save favorite quotes
- View quote history (30 days)
- Works completely offline
- Fast (<1 second startup)

### Constitutional Principles

The demo uses 3 principles:

1. **Simplicity First** (max 5 dependencies)
2. **Speed Matters** (<1 second startup)
3. **Inspiration Over Features** (no feature creep)

These demonstrate how constitution constrains AI decisions.
