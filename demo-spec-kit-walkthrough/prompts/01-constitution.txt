/speckit.constitution Create a constitution for the daily-quote CLI with these core principles:

PRINCIPLE I: Simplicity First
- Maximum 5 npm dependencies (no exceptions)
- No external APIs or network calls
- Single responsibility: display inspiring quotes
- Rationale: A tool used daily must be reliable and lightweight

PRINCIPLE II: Speed Matters
- Startup time < 1 second on average hardware
- Quote display must be instant (no loading spinners)
- Minimal disk I/O (quotes loaded once)
- Rationale: Users check this in the morning; every second counts

PRINCIPLE III: Inspiration Over Features
- Focus on high-quality curated quotes
- No feature creep (sharing, themes, etc. in v1)
- Professional and appropriate content only
- Rationale: One thing done excellently beats ten things done poorly

Establish gates to enforce these principles during planning and implementation.
