/speckit.clarify Answer the clarification questions:

1. Quote database size: Start with 365 quotes (one per day for a year)
   - Can expand later if needed
   - Stored in data/quotes.json

2. Favorites limit: No hard limit, but UI shows most recent 20
   - Stored in ~/.daily-quote/favorites.json

3. History retention: Last 30 days only
   - Automatically prune older entries
   - Stored in ~/.daily-quote/history.json

4. Sharing features: NOT in v1
   - Violates "Simplicity First" principle
   - May consider in v2 if user demand exists

5. Quote selection algorithm: Deterministic based on date
   - dayOfYear % totalQuotes
   - Same date = same quote for all users
   - Predictable and testable

6. Error handling: Graceful degradation
   - Missing quotes.json → show built-in fallback quote
   - Corrupted favorites → recreate empty file
   - Never crash; always show something useful
